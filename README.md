## Introduction
This Dockerfile will build a container image for nginx with php-fpm for running WHMCS. It ships with ionCube loader as well as WHMCS itself (v7.1.1 at present). The image is based on Ubuntu 14.04 and nginx+php-fpm.

**Note**: You will need a valid [WHMCS license](http://www.whmcs.com) to use WHMCS.

## Repositories

### GitHub
The source files for this project are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bliss/hosted-whmcs)

### Docker Hub
The Docker Hub page for this project can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/bliss/hosted-whmcs).

## Usage

### Pulling from Docker Hub
To pull this Dockerfile from Docker Hub:

	docker pull bliss/hosted-whmcs

### Building from source
You can build this container from source with:

	git clone https://github.com/bliss/hosted-whmcs.git
	docker build -t "bliss/hosted-whmcs" .

### Running
Run the container with minimal configuration and options:

	docker run --name <container_name> -p 80:80 -d -h <container_hostname> bliss/hosted-whmcs

This will run the container, and you can then run the WHMCS installer by browsing to http://docker-host:8080

### Other options

#### Linking volumes

Syntax: `-v /host/path:/container/path`

You can use Docker to link a path within the container to a path on the host. For example, to expose the web server's document root on the Docker host at `/opt/whmcs`, you could use:

	docker run --name kd_whmcs -p 80:80 -d -v /opt/whmcs:/usr/share/nginx/html bliss/hosted-whmcs

#### Configuration

This image expects MySQL connection parameters and license to be passed as environment variables:

#### DB_USERNAME

Username to log in to MySQL server

#### DB_HOST

MySQL host IP address or name

#### DB_NAME

MySQL database

#### DB_PASSWORD

MySQL user password

#### LICENSE

WHMCS license

#### TEMPLATES_COMPILEDIR

Optional. If not specified templates_compiledir defaults to templates_c

#### DOMAIN

By default, virtual host server name is not set. Just pass environment variable DOMAIN to set it (it's required for license verification)

#### PHP Errors

By default, PHP errors are logged but not displayed to the end user in the browser. To change this default, you can set the `ERRORS` environment variable to `true`.

Syntax: `-e 'ERRORS=true'`

#### PHP Timezone

PHP requires a timezone to be set explicitly, so we pass this in using the `PHPTZ` environment variable. If this is not specified, it will be defaulted to `Europe/London`.

Syntax: `-e 'PHPTZ=America/New_York'`
